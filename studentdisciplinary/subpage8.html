				<h1>Implementation Of Findings Of The SDC</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>If the SDC finds an accused student:</li>
					<ol>
						<li>guilty, the student is notified in writing of the finding and the sanction(s) imposed by the SDC. In the Notice, the student is further informed of his/her right to appeal against the finding(s) and/or the sanction(s) imposed;</li>
						<li>not guilty, the student is notified in writing of the finding of the SDC.</li>
					</ol>
					<li>If the student is a minor, no disciplinary measure(s) will be taken against that student before his/her parent or guardian has also been informed in writing of his/her alleged misconduct and has been given a proper opportunity to make a written statement
						and, if he/she so wishes, to appear before the SDC in person.</li>
					<li>A student who has been found guilty of misconduct may, within fourteen calendar days of being informed of the finding of the SDC, appeal to the SDAC in writing by lodging a written Notice of Appeal with the Registrar, provided that a student who
						has been found guilty of misconduct after having pleaded guilty to the charge against him/her has no right of appeal against such finding, but may still appeal against the sanction.</li>
					<li>The appellant furnishes, in writing, detailed grounds for his/her appeal in the Notice of Appeal.</li>
